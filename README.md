## Description

This program is a web-based to-do list. It allows the user to enter tasks which are then stored in a database and displayed on the UI. 

The user may also mark individual tasks complete, and delete tasks. These changes are also saved to the database. 

The UI displays the completion status of tasks along with a timestamp of when a task was marked complete.

Adding a task removes the contents of the input field. The input will not accept blank task names. The user will also be prompted to confirm when they attempt to delete an incomplete task.
